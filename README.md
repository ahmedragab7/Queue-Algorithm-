# Queue-Algorithm-
This Project is a good practice to implement The most common Two methods to Make Queue data structure . 
The first method : Two pointers . 
The second method : two index

The second method is more Efficient becouse we use this formula as an index for the array : (get_index&(queue_size-1)) This formula act as :
if(get_index>queue_size){get_index=0}
